# A start for your ringtone app
A flutter app that retrieves 30-second music clips from the itunes API that can be played and downloaded.This can further developed to make a ringtone app.I have done the basic working part of the music player and used almost all of the functionalites provided by the API .I have put everything in main.dart to help me debug things.I recommend to split into pages in further development.Hope this will help as a start to your development:)<br>
